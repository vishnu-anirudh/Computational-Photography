Correction of artefacts in old films

This code is implemented in MATLAB and is done as part of COMPGV15 - Computational Photography and Capture in University College London.

This code deals with correction of artefacts in old films. Thus, it detects and corrects blotches, corrects camera shake in the video and corrects the vertical artefacts by applying median filter.
